## We’ve been keeping an eye on you.

One night, Kyra receives a mysterious email that changes her life forever. By replying, she tumbles into an adventure that begins in the colourful crashes of London, onto the winding depths of the Beijing hutongs and beyond.

Mithra is a puzzle game currently being developed by Seventh Disorder Studios steeped in the mysteries of the world’s first “cult”, Mithraism.  The player follows Kyra, a young girl from Brixton, South London, whose ties to the ancient group run deeper than she ever thought possible.  What unfolds is a surreal tale of loneliness, corruption, evil and the power of us that mirrors the most addictive rabbit hole you’ve ever found yourself lost down.

Combining a striking visual style, bespoke audio engineering, player intuitive game design with carefully crafted narrative, Mithra sets out to show that a good game can be just that and more. Puzzles that blur the lines between abstract thinking and logic, locations that sweep you in, filmic writing and sound that instantly draws you into an alternate world – this is a game made by players who understand the potential of the medium and whose enthusiasm seeks to push it even further.
